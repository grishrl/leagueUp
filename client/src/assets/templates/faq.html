                                            3.0.4 The NGS league will be divided into divisions based on enrollment
                                            numbers.
                                            Teams are placed into divisions based on the averaged MMR of their four
                                            highest MMR players. A list of divisions and their MMR ranges will be posted
                                            here once placements are complete.

                                            What this means is where the Placement Committee begins! They take the top 4 highest MMR players (MMR calculated by taking a flat average of an individual player’s UR, HL, TL and then averaging between said 4 players) on your team’s roster (total of 5-9
                                            players). This sets up an initial placement spread and helps to create upper and lower bound ideas between each Division. After that, they look at your past performance in NGS as a team if applicable or as known
                                            individuals from prior seasons. This works as an unofficial promotion/demotion system for past playoff teams or lower ranking teams and Grand Champions as well! They also take into account any outside performance
                                            in other leagues or tournaments if that information is relevant, available or provided. Other discretions of placements are solely based on the decisions of the Placement Committee in an effort to provide the
                                            best competition experience for all Divisions as equally as possible!

                                            All teams are pingable in discord! The first recommendation is to ping the entire team in your division chat channel and request that someone from the team contact you in lieu of their captain being unresponsive. With this, it is also important to immediately
                                            contact your Division Moderator about the issue and they can reach out as well.

                                            to understand and know where to find this information as it also has the structure and format of the season and other topics.</p>

                                            We recommend you familiarize yourself with setting up your own custom lobby. Some casters may set one up for you or the opposing team captain, but it is always best that you know yourself too!

                                            Overall, it should be appropriate enough for casters to say on twitch stream without repercussion and appropriate enough for a minor to see. While NGS is not 100% family friendly, many participants and volunteers are parents and others are under the age
                                            of 18 so the use of mature themes will likely be requested to change before the season begins.
